## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Classes to Create
```swift
// AI Engine
protocol BanqiAI
class BanqiAIEngine
class MoveGenerator
class PositionEvaluator
class SearchEngine

// AI Implementations
class BeginnerAI: BanqiAI
class IntermediateAI: BanqiAI
class AdvancedAI: BanqiAI
class ExpertAI: BanqiAI

// Game Management
class GameModeManager
class SinglePlayerGameController

// UI Components
class MainMenuScene
class GameModeSelectionScene
class DifficultySelectionScene
```

### Modified Existing Classes
- [ ] `BanqiGame`: Add AI player support
- [ ] `GameScene`: Add AI move handling
- [ ] `GameViewController`: Add scene transitions

### Data Models
- [ ] `GameMode` enum (twoPlayer, singlePlayer)
- [ ] `PlayerType` enum (human, ai)
- [ ] `GameSettings` struct for AI preferences
- [ ] `GameStatistics` struct for tracking

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [ ] AI move generation accuracy
- [ ] Position evaluation consistency
